# WeedFinder.ai Business Plan Overview
*From POC to $5-10M Acquisition*

## Executive Summary

WeedFinder.ai is an AI-powered cannabis product discovery platform that solves the "menu overwhelm" problem facing dispensary customers. By combining natural language search with live inventory data, we enable shoppers to find products based on desired effects ("help me focus without anxiety") rather than strain names.

**The Opportunity:**
- 15,000 licensed dispensaries in the US (Pew Research, 2024)
- Average dispensary carries 300-500 SKUs, creating decision paralysis
- Current search tools (Weedmaps, Leafly) use primitive keyword matching
- No platform combines AI search with real-time inventory across multiple POS systems

**Business Model Evolution:**
1. **Widget SaaS** ($49-149/store/month) - Embedded AI search for dispensary websites
2. **Budtender Copilot** ($99-199/store/month) - In-store upsell recommendations
3. **Data Insights Platform** ($5-10k/quarter/brand) - Market intelligence and analytics

**Financial Projections:**
- Month 12: $22k MRR (250 stores), founder salary sustainable
- Month 30: $1M+ ARR, ready for acquisition
- Exit valuation: $5-10M (4-6x ARR multiple)

**Competitive Advantages:**
- Multi-POS inventory normalization (proprietary dataset)
- Intent + outcome data (search → purchase correlation)
- Embedded distribution model (harder to displace)
- No external funding required (bootstrap-friendly)

## Key Success Metrics

| Phase | Timeline | Stores | MRR | Key Milestone |
|-------|----------|--------|-----|---------------|
| POC | Month 0-1 | 1 | $49 | Live widget proving basket lift |
| MVP | Month 2-6 | 25 | $1.2k | Multi-POS adapters, automated ROI |
| Growth | Month 7-18 | 250 | $22k | Founder salary sustainable |
| Scale | Month 19-30 | 500+ | $50k+ | Data platform revenue |
| Exit | Month 30-36 | - | $83k+ | $1M+ ARR, acquisition ready |

## Risk Mitigation

**Technical Risks:**
- POS API changes → Build adapter pattern with fallback CSV imports
- LLM cost escalation → Migrate to local models (Mistral) after scale

**Market Risks:**
- Incumbent competition → Speed to market, exclusive POS partnerships
- Regulatory changes → Non-plant-touching SaaS, compliance-first design

**Business Risks:**
- Customer acquisition → Budtender referral program, automated ROI proof
- Cash flow → Consulting bridge income, no external funding needed

## Next Steps

1. **Week 1:** Deploy POC widget on local dispensary
2. **Week 2:** Implement automated basket-lift tracking
3. **Month 1:** Build canonical schema + pgvector search
4. **Month 2:** Launch Stripe billing, target 10 stores
5. **Month 3:** Begin Copilot development for pilot stores
